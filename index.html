          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Data from researchers have suggested that high school is a leading stressor for most teenagers. The number of students who have said they feel stressed or a change in mood from school has increased since the pandemic. (Schwartz 4). Sherry Jones is a part of the division of adolescent and school health with a Ph.D. Dr. Jones states that students feel a wide range of ongoing stress in secondary school students feel for multiple different reasons from school. Dr.Jones surveyed students during the pandemic and asked students about how they felt “Respondents in 2020 were four times more likely to report feeling sad (46% vs. 11%) and six times more likely to feel hopeless (38% vs. 6%)” (Jones 9). The piece of evidence shows how the pandemic caused a negative impact on high school kid's mental health such as through social isolation and not being in a learning environment,  which caused them to have a decrease in academic performance. That decrease in their academic efficiency caused them to  stressed out from falling behind on their grades.

          <h4>First Argument</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Academic stress is a form of mental distress that arises from academic challenges or failure. This type of stress comes from a heavy workload, challenging assignments, exams, competition, and the desire to meet high academic expectations. This is an issue because the heavy workload is what causes the most stress and affects the mental health of students. Researcher Sherry Jones reports “66% of students reported feeling stressed about poor grades and 59% reported that they often worry that taking a test will be difficult ”(Jones 4). Jones’ research suggests that the leading cause of stress in school is poor grades. Academic performance can put a heavy burden on students and can have a negative impact on their mental health. Even so, in an article written by Maria Guadalupe who is a scholar who went to the University of Guanajuato, she conducted research on high school. Maria Guadalupe asked students what their main causes of stress were. The students reported that their main sources of stress were: “1) exams, 2) homework and work outside of school, and 3) personal problems.”(Guadalupe 2 ).   These findings highlight the immense pressure that students experience from their academics. The burden of homework, exams, poor grades, and the expectations for their academic performance put a tremendous strain on their mental health.Therefore, it is essential to address the issue of student stress and provide them with the necessary support and resources to manage their academic and personal lives effectively.

          <h4>Second Argument</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Social loneliness is the feeling of isolation or a lack of meaningful social connections. It is the emotional state that occurs when individuals perceive a gap between their desired and actual social relationships. This is an issue because due to students not having anyone to talk to about their problems it could cause them to be depressed or sad—another article written by Kelly Dean Schwartz who graduated from the University of Calgary with a child psychology degree. However, Kelly Dean explains how the percentage of students between the ages of 15 and 18 feel stressed in school. For example, “many adolescents reported being generally bored saying many adolescents reported being generally bored (71%), feeling quite normal (41%), missing their friends (54%), being academically unmotivated (60%)”(Schwartz 3).This. research suggests that most students felt normal while 60% of students felt academically unmotivated and missing their friends through their social isolation. This research adds on to the growing factor that educational institutions should create plans to help students during times of crisis, such as pandemics or natural disasters. These plans should help students stay connected to their peers and teachers, and they should also provide support for students who are struggling academically or emotionally.

          <h4>First Solution</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Teachers motivating students who are feeling stressed out will decrease the stress the students may have. Motivation is important for learning environments because when students are motivated they are more engaged with their learning, studies, assignments, and academic performance. If students were unmotivated it would cause them to procrastinate and have terrible academic outcomes which can cause an increase in stress levels. Research from Jhoselle Tus who wrote multiple articles about academic performance and self-esteem says high school students face a multitude of problems and suggests that motivation can be beneficial for students. Tus states  “If the students' motivation process was high, and there is explicit instruction, test scores increased. The study concluded that under conditions of high clarity in instruction, students with higher motivation exhibited higher scores than those with lower motivation.” (Tus 3).  This quote shows that students who gain a lot of motivation to do work from staff members tend to score higher on tests. This highlights the fact that if you encourage students to work hard, their grades and academic performance increase. Teachers should help motivate students because it helps them feel connected or valued in their school's community which can contribute to their academic success.

        <div>
            <p class="light"> Counselors can help students by being their mental health counselors and assisting students with their social emotions. Students knowing about people caring about their thoughts or feelings can help build a better social environment.  A quote by Robert Pinsus “School staff notice mental health issues before families since students normally spend most of their time at school”(Pinsus). This text highlights the importance of staff members being able to notice when children are feeling stressed or upset. By doing so, it emphasizes how school counselors can offer a valuable resource for students to talk about their issues, which can help reduce stress and improve their social skills. School officials must be proactive about this issue, as stress can have a significant negative impact on attendance and academic performance. Students who are stressed tend to miss school more often and struggle to concentrate in class. School officials need to be proactive about this because stress causes a negative impact on students' attendance and performance such as missing school and they also tend to struggle to concentrate in class.
